                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                
                <p>Imagine you want to build a house. You could gather raw materials—lumber, nails, concrete—and figure out how to construct everything from scratch. Or you could use pre-fabricated components, power tools, and established blueprints that handle the complex engineering for you. A <strong>game engine</strong> is like that second approach: it's a comprehensive toolkit that handles the heavy lifting of creating interactive 3D experiences, letting you focus on bringing your creative vision to life.</p>
                
                <div class="card" style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%); color: white;">
                    <h4>📖 Definition</h4>
                    <p style="color: white;"><strong>Game Engine:</strong> A software framework designed to create video games and other interactive 3D applications. It provides core functionality like rendering graphics, simulating physics, playing audio, handling input, and managing game logic—so developers don't have to build these systems from scratch.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p><strong>Unreal Engine</strong> is one of the most powerful and widely-used game engines in the world. Developed by Epic Games, it powers everything from blockbuster video games like <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> to Hollywood productions like <em>The Mandalorian</em>. But its reach extends far beyond entertainment—architects use it to visualize buildings before they're constructed, automotive companies design virtual car showrooms, and medical professionals train surgeons in virtual operating rooms.</p>
                
                <p>What makes Unreal Engine special? Three things stand out:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Visual Fidelity:</strong> Unreal Engine is renowned for producing stunning, photorealistic graphics that rival pre-rendered CGI</li>
                    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Its visual scripting system called "Blueprints" allows creators to build complex functionality without writing traditional code</li>
                    <li><strong>Free to Use:</strong> Unreal Engine is completely free until your project earns over $1 million in revenue</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="card" style="background: #e8f5e9; border-left: 4px solid #4CAF50;">
                    <h4>✅ Why This Matters</h4>
                    <p>Understanding what Unreal Engine is and what it can do helps you appreciate the tool you're about to learn. Whether your goal is game development, film production, architectural visualization, or something entirely different, Unreal Engine provides a foundation that can take you there.</p>

            <section id="history" class="lesson-section">
                <h2>History of Unreal Engine and Epic Games</h2>
                
                <p>Every powerful tool has an origin story. Understanding where Unreal Engine came from helps you appreciate how it evolved into the industry titan it is today.</p>
                
                <h3>The Birth of Epic Games (1991)</h3>
                
                <p>Epic Games was founded in 1991 by Tim Sweeney, working out of his parents' house in Potomac, Maryland. Originally called "Potomac Computer Systems," the company started by creating simple games and productivity software. Sweeney was a self-taught programmer with a passion for pushing technical boundaries—a trait that would define Epic's future.</p>
                
                <h3>Unreal: The Game That Started It All (1998)</h3>
                
                <p>In 1998, Epic released <em>Unreal</em>, a first-person shooter that stunned the gaming world. While the game itself was successful, what truly impressed the industry was the underlying technology. The Unreal Engine featured advanced 3D rendering, dynamic lighting, and a level design toolkit that was ahead of its time.</p>
                
                <p>Epic made a pivotal decision: license this technology to other developers. This transformed Epic from just a game studio into a technology company. Studios could now use the same powerful tools that created <em>Unreal</em> to build their own games.</p>

                    <h4>💡 Did You Know?</h4>
                    <p>The decision to make Unreal Engine 4 free in 2014 was revolutionary. Previously, licensing a professional game engine could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars upfront. By switching to a royalty model (5% of revenue after the first $1 million), Epic made professional game development accessible to indie developers, students, and hobbyists worldwide. With UE5, the threshold increased to $1 million before royalties kick in.</p>

            <!-- Section 3: Real-Time vs Pre-Rendered -->
            <section id="realtime-vs-prerendered" class="lesson-section">
                <h2>Real-Time vs. Pre-Rendered Graphics</h2>
                
                <p>To understand why Unreal Engine is so impressive, you need to grasp a fundamental concept in computer graphics: the difference between <strong>real-time rendering</strong> and <strong>pre-rendered graphics</strong>.</p>
                
                <h3>Pre-Rendered Graphics</h3>
                
                <p>Think of a Pixar movie like <em>Toy Story</em> or <em>Finding Nemo</em>. Every frame of these films is meticulously calculated by powerful computers—often taking hours or even days to render a single frame. The result is stunning, photorealistic imagery with complex lighting, reflections, and details. However, because this process is so computationally expensive, it must be done ahead of time. The final movie is essentially a very fancy video file—you can watch it, but you can't interact with it or change anything.</p>
                
                <div class="card" style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%); color: white;">
                    <h4>📖 Definition</h4>
                    <p style="color: white;"><strong>Pre-Rendered Graphics:</strong> Images or animations that are computed in advance, often taking minutes to hours per frame. Used in films, animated movies, and high-quality cinematics where interactivity isn't needed.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Real-Time Rendering</h3>
                
                <p>Now imagine playing a video game. As you move your character, the entire scene—lighting, shadows, reflections, physics—must be calculated and displayed <em>instantly</em>, typically 30 to 60 times per second (or even higher). This is real-time rendering: generating images fast enough that they appear smooth and responsive to user input.</p>
                
                <div class="card" style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%); color: white;">
                    <h4>📖 Definition</h4>
                    <p style="color: white;"><strong>Real-Time Rendering:</strong> The process of generating images fast enough for interactive applications, typically 30-60+ frames per second. Used in video games, simulations, VR/AR, and interactive visualizations.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>The Challenge and the Breakthrough</h3>
                
                <p>Historically, there was a massive quality gap between pre-rendered and real-time graphics. Movies looked gorgeous; games looked... like games. But that gap has been shrinking rapidly, and Unreal Engine 5 represents a major leap forward.</p>

                <h3>Why This Matters for Unreal Engine</h3>
                
                <p>Unreal Engine 5's headline features—<strong>Nanite</strong> and <strong>Lumen</strong>—are specifically designed to bring film-quality visuals into real-time applications:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nanite:</strong> A virtualized geometry system that allows you to import film-quality assets with millions of polygons directly into your scene, and the engine automatically optimizes them for real-time display</li>
                    <li><strong>Lumen:</strong> A global illumination system that simulates how light bounces around a scene in real-time, creating realistic lighting without the hours-long render times traditionally required</li>
                </ul>

                    <p>While UE5 dramatically closes the gap between real-time and pre-rendered graphics, there are still scenarios where pre-rendering is preferred—particularly when you need absolute maximum quality and have no interactivity requirements. However, for most game development, architectural visualization, and even many film/TV productions, real-time rendering in UE5 is now "good enough" and offers massive advantages in iteration speed and flexibility.</p>

                    <h4>⚠️ A Note on Engine Wars</h4>
                    <p>Online discussions about game engines can get heated. Remember: the "best" engine depends entirely on your project, team, and goals. Many successful studios use multiple engines for different projects. The skills you learn—3D math, game design principles, programming logic—transfer between engines. Focus on learning deeply rather than arguing about which tool is superior.</p>
